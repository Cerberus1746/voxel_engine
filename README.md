# Design Choices
* The game editor will be able to be used as a voxel editor, and level editor. Texture editor will be a maybe, but probably made because that sounds fun.
* Game samples shall look different than Minecraft
* If something is procedually generated, they shall be able to be seen in the editor.
* I went to Graphics Design College, so things shall look pretty.
* Implementation before performance - I rather have something working than taking a millisecond less in a calculation.
* The main language will be C# - But the API must be, somehow, accessible by scripting languages like Python. Even if I need to make the interpreter myself.
* I won't make a scripting language myself. Needing to learn even a new language to use a new tool is something I don't like much.
* In the same light, existing formats shall be used instead for images, models and etc. Unless there's no format available for the thing I wanna do.
* Everything needs to be multiplatform.
